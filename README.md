### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Here's a few bits about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an SEIR model of COVID-19 transmission with Dr. Edwin Michael at the University of South Florida. Our main goal is to predict cases, deaths, and hospitalizations for counties around Tampa Bay.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™ve been diving into reinforcement learning and training algorithms to learn optimal policies. I'm also quite passionate about cryptocurrency and cryptography in general.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m excited to collaborate on interesting machine learning/artificial intelligence projects.
