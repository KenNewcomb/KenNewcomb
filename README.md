### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ken, a computational scientist. Here's a little bit about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an SEIR model of COVID-19 transmission.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning more about reinforcement learning and training agents to act optimally. I'm also quite passionate about cryptocurrency and cryptography in general.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any machine learning projects.
