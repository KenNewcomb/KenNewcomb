### Hi, I'm Ken. 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on an predictive model of COVID-19 transmission with Dr. Edwin Michael at the University of South Florida. Our main goal is to predict cases, deaths, and hospitalizations for counties around Tampa Bay.
- 🌱 I'm quite passionate about computational modeling, bitcoin, and computers in general.
- 🏐 I'm also building [a model to forecast the outcome of professional sports](https://ken.rocks/odds).
